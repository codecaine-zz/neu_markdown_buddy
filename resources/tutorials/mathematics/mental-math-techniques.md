### ‚≠ê Multiplying by 10

**The easiest trick ever:** Just add a zero to the end!

**Why this works:** When you multiply by 10, everything gets 10 times bigger. Adding a zero does exactly that!

**Examples:**

- 47 √ó 10 = **470** (just stick a 0 on the end)
- 125 √ó 10 = **1250** (just stick a 0 on the end)
- 8 √ó 10 = **80** (just stick a 0 on the end)
- 3 √ó 10 = **30** (just stick a 0 on the end)

**üí™ Try these yourself:**
- 56 √ó 10 = ? *(Answer: 560)*
- 14 √ó 10 = ? *(Answer: 140)*
- 200 √ó 10 = ? *(Answer: 2000)*

**Real-life use:** Calculating prices when buying 10 of something!

### ‚≠ê Finding 10% of Any Number

**Super simple:** Move the decimal point one place to the left (or just cross off the last digit and put a decimal).

**Step-by-step:**
1. Look at your number (example: 250)
2. Imagine there's a decimal at the end: 250.
3. Move it one space left: 25.0
4. That's your answer: 25

**Examples:**

- 10% of 250 ‚Üí **25.0** (move the dot left one space)
- 10% of 84 ‚Üí **8.4** (move the dot left one space)
- 10% of 1000 ‚Üí **100.0** (move the dot left one space)
- 10% of 30 ‚Üí **3.0** (move the dot left one space)

**Think of it this way:** Just make the number 10 times smaller!

**üí™ Try these yourself:**
- 10% of 150 = ? *(Answer: 15)*
- 10% of 60 = ? *(Answer: 6)*
- 10% of 500 = ? *(Answer: 50)*

**Why this matters:** Once you can find 10%, you can find ANY percentage! (see the percentage section below)

**Real-life use:** Quick tip calculations, sale discounts, understanding tax amounts!

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ ADDITION TRICKS

### ‚ú® Round Up and Fix It

**The idea:** Round numbers to make them easier, then fix your answer.

**Why this works:** It's easier to add 80 + 30 than 73 + 28. Our brain likes round numbers!

**Example: 73 + 28** *(Let's go slow)*

**Step 1:** Round to easy numbers
- 73 ‚Üí round up to 80 (you added 7 extra)
- 28 ‚Üí round up to 30 (you added 2 extra)
- *Write this down: added 7 and added 2*

**Step 2:** Add the easy numbers
- 80 + 30 = 110 *(much easier!)*

**Step 3:** Fix it (take away the extras)
- You added 7 + 2 = 9 too much
- Take it back: 110 - 9 = **101** ‚úì

**Think of it like this:** You borrowed 9 extra dollars, now pay it back!

**More examples:**

**Example: 164 + 279**

- Round: 170 + 280 = 450
- Fix: You added 6 + 1 = 7
- Answer: 450 - 7 = **443**

**Example: 52 + 399**

- Round: 50 + 400 = 450
- Fix: You rounded 52 DOWN by 2 and 399 UP by 1
- So: 450 - 1 + 2 = **451** (or easier: 52 + 400 - 1 = 451)

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ SUBTRACTION TRICKS

### ‚ú® Round Up and Fix (for Subtraction)

**The idea:** Round the SECOND number up, subtract, then add back what you rounded.

**Example: 382 - 149**

**Step 1:** Round the second number up

- 149 ‚Üí round to 150 (you added 1)

**Step 2:** Subtract the easy number

- 382 - 150 = 232

**Step 3:** Add back what you rounded

- 232 + 1 = **233**

**Why this works:** When we rounded 149 to 150, we subtracted TOO MUCH. So we need to add a little back.

**More examples:**

- 560 - 237 ‚Üí 560 - 240 = 320, then 320 + 3 = **323**
- 1000 - 68 ‚Üí 1000 - 70 = 930, then 930 + 2 = **932**

---

### ‚ú® The "9-9-10" Rule (Subtracting from 1000)

**The magic rule:** To subtract any 3-digit number from 1000, use this pattern:

- **First digit:** 9 minus that digit
- **Second digit:** 9 minus that digit
- **Last digit:** 10 minus that digit

**Example: 1000 - 274**

1. First digit (2): 9 - 2 = **7**
2. Second digit (7): 9 - 7 = **2**
3. Last digit (4): 10 - 4 = **6**
4. Put together: **726**

**More examples:**

- 1000 - 639 ‚Üí (9-6)(9-3)(10-9) = **361**
- 1000 - 845 ‚Üí (9-8)(9-4)(10-5) = **155**
- 1000 - 123 ‚Üí (9-1)(9-2)(10-3) = **877**

**Memory trick:** "Nine, nine, ten‚Äînow you win!"

---

### ‚ú® Subtracting from 100

**The pattern:** To subtract any 2-digit number from 100:

- **Tens digit:** 9 minus that digit
- **Ones digit:** 10 minus that digit

**Example: 100 - 68**

1. Tens (6): 9 - 6 = **3**
2. Ones (8): 10 - 8 = **2**
3. Answer: **32**

**More examples:**

- 100 - 54 ‚Üí (9-5)(10-4) = **46**
- 100 - 87 ‚Üí (9-8)(10-7) = **13**
- 100 - 23 ‚Üí (9-2)(10-3) = **77**

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ MULTIPLICATION TRICKS

### ‚ú® Multiplying by 5

**The trick:** Multiply by 10 (easy!), then cut it in half.

**Why this works:** 5 is exactly half of 10, so we multiply by 10 (just add a zero) then take half.

**Example: 63 √ó 5** *(Step by step)*

**Step 1:** Multiply by 10 *(you already know this!)*
- 63 √ó 10 = 630 (just add a zero)

**Step 2:** Cut in half *(divide by 2)*
- 630 √∑ 2 = **315**
- *Hint: 600 √∑ 2 = 300, and 30 √∑ 2 = 15, so 300 + 15 = 315*

**More examples with clear steps:**

**Example: 84 √ó 5**
- Step 1: 84 √ó 10 = 840
- Step 2: 840 √∑ 2 = **420** *(80 √∑ 2 = 40, so 840 √∑ 2 = 420)*

**Example: 46 √ó 5**
- Step 1: 46 √ó 10 = 460
- Step 2: 460 √∑ 2 = **230** *(easy: half of 460)*

**üí™ Try these yourself:**
- 22 √ó 5 = ? *(Answer: 220 √∑ 2 = 110)*
- 38 √ó 5 = ? *(Answer: 380 √∑ 2 = 190)*

**Real-life use:** Money calculations (5 dollar bills, 5 cents each, etc.)!

---

### ‚ú® Multiplying by 9

**The trick:** Multiply by 10, then subtract the original number.

**Example: 57 √ó 9**

1. Multiply by 10: 57 √ó 10 = 570
2. Subtract original: 570 - 57 = **513**

**Need help subtracting?**

- 570 - 57
- Think: 570 - 50 = 520
- Then: 520 - 7 = **513**

**More examples:**

- 34 √ó 9 ‚Üí 340 - 34 = **306**
- 25 √ó 9 ‚Üí 250 - 25 = **225**
- 123 √ó 9 ‚Üí 1230 - 123 = **1107**

**Why this works:** 9 is one less than 10, so we multiply by 10 then take away one copy of the number.

---

### ‚ú® Multiplying by 11 (Two-Digit Numbers)

**The magic pattern:**

1. Write the FIRST digit
2. Add the two digits together
3. Write the LAST digit

**Example: 27 √ó 11**

1. First digit: **2**
2. Add them: 2 + 7 = **9**
3. Last digit: **7**
4. Answer: **297**

**Example with carrying: 64 √ó 11**

1. First digit: **6**
2. Add them: 6 + 4 = **10** (This is two digits!)
3. Last digit: **4**
4. Since the middle is 10, write 0 and carry the 1
5. Add the carry to the first digit: 6 + 1 = 7
6. Answer: **704**

**More examples:**

- 53 √ó 11 ‚Üí 5, (5+3=8), 3 = **583**
- 72 √ó 11 ‚Üí 7, (7+2=9), 2 = **792**
- 85 √ó 11 ‚Üí 8, (8+5=13), 5 ‚Üí **935** (with carry)

### ‚ú® Squaring Numbers Ending in 5 (AMAZING MAGIC!)

**This is the most impressive trick!** Perfect for showing off or checking calculator answers.

**The magic rule:** Any number ending in 5, when squared, follows this pattern:

1. Ignore the 5 for now‚Äîlook at the digit(s) before it (call this N)
2. Multiply N √ó (N+1) *(that means N times the next number)*
3. Write down your answer from step 2
4. Stick "25" at the end
5. Done!

**Example: 65¬≤** (That's 65 √ó 65) - **Super detailed walkthrough:**

**Step 1:** What's before the 5? It's **6**

**Step 2:** What's the next number after 6? It's **7**

**Step 3:** Multiply them: 6 √ó 7 = **42**

**Step 4:** Write 42, then stick 25 on the end: **4225**

**That's it!** 65 √ó 65 = 4225 ‚úì

**Let's do another one slowly: 35¬≤**

- Step 1: What's before the 5? ‚Üí **3**
- Step 2: What's 3 + 1? ‚Üí **4**
- Step 3: Multiply 3 √ó 4 = **12**
- Step 4: Write 12, add 25 at the end ‚Üí **1225** ‚úì

**More examples:**

- 25¬≤ ‚Üí 2 √ó 3 = 6 ‚Üí **625**
- 45¬≤ ‚Üí 4 √ó 5 = 20 ‚Üí **2025**
- 75¬≤ ‚Üí 7 √ó 8 = 56 ‚Üí **5625**
- 85¬≤ ‚Üí 8 √ó 9 = 72 ‚Üí **7225**
- 95¬≤ ‚Üí 9 √ó 10 = 90 ‚Üí **9025**
- 15¬≤ ‚Üí 1 √ó 2 = 2 ‚Üí **225**

**üí™ Try these yourself:**
- 55¬≤ = ? *(Answer: 5 √ó 6 = 30, so 3025)*
- 105¬≤ = ? *(Answer: 10 √ó 11 = 110, so 11025)*

**This is pure magic!** It ALWAYS works for numbers ending in 5. No exceptions!

**Real-life use:** Impress your friends, quickly calculate areas (like 15 feet √ó 15 feet), or double-check calculator answers!

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ ADVANCED MULTIPLICATION TRICKS

### ‚ú® Multiplying Two Numbers Close to Each Other

**When to use:** When multiplying two numbers that are close together (within 5-10 of each other).

**The trick:**

1. Find the number halfway between them (the average)
2. Square that middle number
3. Find how far apart they are from the middle
4. Square that distance
5. Subtract: (middle¬≤) - (distance¬≤)

**Example: 48 √ó 52**

**Step 1:** What's halfway between 48 and 52?
- Average: (48 + 52) √∑ 2 = 100 √∑ 2 = **50**

**Step 2:** Square the middle number
- 50¬≤ = **2500**

**Step 3:** How far are they from the middle?
- 52 is 2 above 50
- 48 is 2 below 50
- Distance: **2**

**Step 4:** Square the distance
- 2¬≤ = **4**

**Step 5:** Subtract
- 2500 - 4 = **2496**

**Why this works:** This uses the algebraic identity (a-b)(a+b) = a¬≤ - b¬≤

**More examples:**

**Example: 23 √ó 27**
- Middle: 25
- 25¬≤ = 625 (use the 5-ending trick!)
- Distance: 2
- 2¬≤ = 4
- Answer: 625 - 4 = **621**

**Example: 96 √ó 104**
- Middle: 100
- 100¬≤ = 10000
- Distance: 4
- 4¬≤ = 16
- Answer: 10000 - 16 = **9984**

### ‚ú® Multiplying by Numbers Near 100

**The trick:** When multiplying by numbers close to 100 (like 97, 103, etc.)

**Formula:** 
1. Find how far from 100 (call this the difference)
2. Add/subtract the difference from the other number
3. Add two zeros
4. Add/subtract (difference √ó ones digit)

**Example: 87 √ó 97**

**Step 1:** How far is 97 from 100?
- 97 is 3 BELOW 100 (difference = -3)

**Step 2:** What's 87 - 3?
- 87 - 3 = 84

**Step 3:** Add two zeros
- 84 ‚Üí **8400**

**Step 4:** What's 87's distance from 100?
- 87 is 13 below 100
- So: 13 √ó 3 = 39
- Since both are below 100, we ADD: 8400 + 39 = **8439**

**Simpler method for this example:**
- 87 √ó 97
- Think: 87 √ó 100 - 87 √ó 3
- = 8700 - 261
- = **8439**

**Example: 94 √ó 103**
- 94 √ó 100 = 9400
- 94 √ó 3 = 282
- 9400 + 282 = **9682**

### ‚ú® Multiplying by 125

**The trick:** Multiply by 1000, then divide by 8.

**Why this works:** 125 √ó 8 = 1000, so 125 = 1000 √∑ 8

**How to divide by 8:** Cut in half three times!

**Example: 24 √ó 125**

**Step 1:** Multiply by 1000
- 24 √ó 1000 = 24000

**Step 2:** Divide by 8 (cut in half 3 times)
- 24000 √∑ 2 = 12000
- 12000 √∑ 2 = 6000
- 6000 √∑ 2 = **3000**

**More examples:**

- 16 √ó 125 ‚Üí 16000 √∑ 8 = **2000**
- 32 √ó 125 ‚Üí 32000 √∑ 8 = **4000**
- 40 √ó 125 ‚Üí 40000 √∑ 8 = **5000**

### ‚ú® Multiplying Two-Digit Numbers (Criss-Cross Method)

**When to use:** Any two-digit multiplication!

**The pattern:** For AB √ó CD:

1. **Ones place:** Multiply B √ó D
2. **Tens place:** Cross-multiply and add: (A √ó D) + (B √ó C)
3. **Hundreds place:** Multiply A √ó C
4. Handle any carrying

**Example: 23 √ó 14** *(Let's break it down)*

Think of 23 as (20 + 3) and 14 as (10 + 4)

**Step 1:** Ones place
- 3 √ó 4 = 12
- Write down **2**, carry the 1

**Step 2:** Tens place (the criss-cross)
- (2 √ó 4) + (3 √ó 1) = 8 + 3 = 11
- Add the carry from step 1: 11 + 1 = 12
- Write down **2**, carry the 1

**Step 3:** Hundreds place
- 2 √ó 1 = 2
- Add the carry: 2 + 1 = **3**

**Answer: 322**

**Visual aid:**
```
    23
  √ó 14
  ----
  1. 3√ó4=12 (write 2, carry 1)
  2. (2√ó4)+(3√ó1)=11, +carry=12 (write 2, carry 1)
  3. 2√ó1=2, +carry=3 (write 3)
  = 322
```

**Another example: 31 √ó 22**

- Ones: 1 √ó 2 = **2**
- Tens: (3 √ó 2) + (1 √ó 2) = 6 + 2 = **8**
- Hundreds: 3 √ó 2 = **6**
- Answer: **682**

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ ADVANCED PERCENTAGE TRICKS

### ‚ú® Finding Any Percentage Using 1%

**The trick:** Find 1% first, then multiply.

**To find 1%:** Move the decimal TWO places left (or divide by 100)

**Example: Find 37% of 250**

**Step 1:** Find 1%
- 250 ‚Üí 2.50 (moved decimal twice)

**Step 2:** Multiply by the percentage you want
- 2.50 √ó 37 = ?
- Think: 2.5 √ó 30 = 75
- Plus: 2.5 √ó 7 = 17.5
- Total: 75 + 17.5 = **92.5**

**Example: Find 8% of 425**

- 1% of 425 = 4.25
- 8% = 4.25 √ó 8 = **34.00**

---

### ‚ú® The Flip Trick (MIND-BLOWING!)

**The secret:** A% of B = B% of A

**This means:** 4% of 75 is the SAME as 75% of 4!

**Why this matters:** Sometimes the flipped version is WAY easier!

**Example: Find 4% of 75** *(the hard way)*

- 1% of 75 = 0.75
- 4% = 0.75 √ó 4 = 3.00

**Example: Find 4% of 75** *(the SMART way)*

- Flip it: 75% of 4
- 75% = 3/4 (three-quarters)
- 3/4 of 4 = **3** ‚úì

**Way easier!**

**More examples:**

- 8% of 25 = 25% of 8 = **2** (much easier!)
- 16% of 50 = 50% of 16 = **8** (just half of 16!)
- 2% of 45 = 45% of 2 = **0.9** (easier to find 45% of 2)

**üí° PRO TIP:** Always check if flipping makes it easier before calculating!

---

### ‚ú® Percentage Increase/Decrease

**To find percentage change:**

1. Find the difference (new - old)
2. Divide by the original
3. Multiply by 100

**Example: Price went from $40 to $50**

**Step 1:** Find difference
- 50 - 40 = 10

**Step 2:** Divide by original
- 10 √∑ 40 = 0.25

**Step 3:** Convert to percentage
- 0.25 √ó 100 = **25% increase**

**Example: Price dropped from $80 to $60**

- Difference: 80 - 60 = 20
- Divide: 20 √∑ 80 = 0.25
- Convert: **25% decrease**

---

### ‚ú® Quick Discount Calculation

**To find final price after a discount:**

Instead of finding the discount and subtracting, find what's LEFT!

**Example: 30% off a $250 item**

**The slow way:**
- Find 30% of 250 = 75
- Subtract: 250 - 75 = 175

**The fast way:**
- 30% off means you pay 70%
- Find 70% of 250
- 10% = 25, so 70% = 25 √ó 7 = **$175**

**More examples:**

- 25% off means pay **75%**
- 40% off means pay **60%**
- 15% off means pay **85%**

## üîü ADVANCED ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES

### ‚ú® Estimating Square Roots

**The trick:** Find perfect squares nearby, then estimate.

**Example: ‚àö50** *(What's the square root of 50?)*

**Step 1:** Find perfect squares nearby
- 49 = 7¬≤ (too small)
- 64 = 8¬≤ (too big)
- So ‚àö50 is between 7 and 8

**Step 2:** See which it's closer to
- 50 is closer to 49 than to 64
- So ‚àö50 is closer to 7

**Step 3:** Estimate
- Roughly **7.1** (actual: 7.07)

**More examples:**

- ‚àö20 ‚Üí between 4¬≤ (16) and 5¬≤ (25) ‚Üí about **4.5** (actual: 4.47)
- ‚àö80 ‚Üí between 8¬≤ (64) and 9¬≤ (81) ‚Üí about **8.9** (actual: 8.94)
- ‚àö30 ‚Üí between 5¬≤ (25) and 6¬≤ (36) ‚Üí about **5.5** (actual: 5.48)

## 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ LIGHTNING-FAST ADDITION & SUBTRACTION

### ‚ú® Adding Three or More Numbers

**The trick:** Look for pairs that make 10, 20, 50, or 100.

**Example: 7 + 28 + 3 + 12**

**Step 1:** Find pairs that make 10
- 7 + 3 = 10
- No other obvious pairs

**Step 2:** Find pairs that make other easy numbers
- 28 + 12 = 40

**Step 3:** Add the easy numbers
- 10 + 40 = **50**

**Example: 15 + 33 + 45 + 17**

- 15 + 45 = 60 (easy pair!)
- 33 + 17 = 50 (easy pair!)
- 60 + 50 = **110**

---

### ‚ú® The Complement Method (Advanced Rounding)

**For subtraction:** Round BOTH numbers to make easier calculation.

**Example: 894 - 467**

**Step 1:** Round both to nearest hundred
- 894 ‚Üí 900 (added 6)
- 467 ‚Üí 500 (added 33)

**Step 2:** Subtract the easy numbers
- 900 - 500 = 400

**Step 3:** Fix the rounding
- We added 6 to the first number (makes answer 6 too big)
- We added 33 to the second number (makes answer 33 too small)
- Net effect: 400 - 6 + 33 = **427**
